Strip the most egregious patterns out of AI writing, reduce noise and make output more readable to actual human beings or AI that cares. The skill reviews or edits a file
against a simple writing style, ships an output style for everyday replies, and
re-explains an answer that came back too dense.

It removes patterns that Anthropic models over-use:

- **X-not-Y** - contrast used for punch where a plain statement is clearer:
  "It should provoke feedback, not look finished."
- **Drumbeat cadence** - stacked fragments that read like a trailer: "One
  harness, two models, blind cross-review. Half-day timebox."
- **Cute labels** - a bolded tag standing in for the point: "**The risk that
  matters most.** Those two needs are a full-time role."
- **Mic-drop closers** - a short line asserting a universal truth to end a
  section: "That is where the real learning happens."
- **Hype words** - unlock, supercharge, seamless, transform, 10x.
- **Characters you cannot type** - em dashes, curly quotes and arrows in place
  of `-`, `"` and `->`.

To get rid of the worst Claude patterns, I have found you have to run the text
through _another_ model. I use GPT. These patterns look baked into the training
data: after a lot of day-to-day use and several rounds of improvements, a skill
with examples and antipatterns still does not catch them in the model that
wrote the text. This skill routes the work elsewhere.

My suggestion is to read through the skill, play with it, then fork it or write
your own. The rules in `references/` are mine, so treat them as a starting
point for yours. Contributions are welcome when they help everyone, such as a
new harness integration in `dispatch.sh` or a guideline that applies regardless
of who is writing.

## Before and after

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| **The change that matters most.** We shipped the new ingest path, not a rewrite. Three things landed: batching, retries, backpressure. This unlocks a seamless experience for downstream teams -- and that is where the real win is. | We shipped the new ingest path by extending the existing code. It adds batching, retries and backpressure, so downstream teams no longer have to handle partial batches themselves. |

The before column uses most of the patterns above. The bolded opener is a
cute label doing the work a sentence should do. "not a rewrite" is X-not-Y.
"Three things landed" counts a list the reader can see, and the three nouns
after it are drumbeat cadence. "Unlocks" and "seamless" are hype. The dash
would be an em dash in the original. The closing clause is a mic-drop, and it
disappears once the actual benefit is stated.

## Install

```sh
npx skills add michellexyq/editor
```

## Try it out

> **Prompt:** /editor "review this README, don't rewrite -- just tell me what's wrong"

## What it does

A model that has written a file may overlook problems when reviewing its own work. This skill sends the file and my writing-style rules to another model. It returns either a list of issues or an edited version.

- **Review mode** - say "review", "check", "list", or "don't rewrite" to get a numbered list of issues. Each item includes the line, the problem and a suggested fix. The file is left unchanged.
- **Edit mode** - for other instructions, the skill rewrites the file and shows you a short summary before saving it.
- **Quick mode** - `/editor quick` cleans the file in the current session with
  whatever model is running. It fixes the clearest violations and leaves the
  rest, so use it on low-stakes copy or when you want a fast pass.
- **Wtf mode** - `/editor wtf` re-explains the last message in the current
  session. It rewrites what was said in short, plain English, without adding to
  it.
- **Choose a model** - `gpt` (the default), `luna` and `o3` run in a new
  process through Codex. `claude` runs in the current session.

Every response ends with the harness and model that did the work, such as
`Editor: Codex, dispatched as a new process, model gpt-5.6-sol`, so you can see
what produced the response.

The style rules and before-and-after examples live in `references/`. These references give each review the same criteria.

## Examples

```text
/editor "clean this up"
/editor gpt "what are the top 10 things you'd rewrite here? don't change anything"
/editor "don't rewrite, tell me what is wrong"
/editor claude "simplify section 6"
/editor quick
/editor wtf
```

## How it works

`/editor [model] "<instructions>"` builds a prompt from the writing-style
references and the target file. It passes that prompt to `dispatch.sh`, which
runs the chosen model. The CLI-specific details live in `dispatch.sh`, so edit
it to add a model or use a different harness.

Machine-specific setup, such as an API key, goes in a `dispatch.local.sh` that
`dispatch.sh` sources and the repo ignores. See
[docs/customisation.md](./docs/customisation.md).

## Output styles

This skill works on a file. To apply the same conventions to every response,
use an output style. In Claude Code, run `/config` and pick one. Claude Code
puts the output style in the system prompt, which is generally more reliable
than the same instruction in `CLAUDE.md`.

Ask for the writing you want:

- "Explain it like I'm five. Lead with the answer, then give the detail."
- "Use ASD-STE100 simplified technical English. No jargon, and define any
  acronym you do use."
- "Answer in five sentences or fewer unless I ask for more."

Install a basic output style based on the conventions in the skill:

```sh
# Ensure we have a Claude Code output style directory.
mkdir -p ~/.claude/output-styles

# Download the dwmkerr-editor output style.
curl -o ~/.claude/output-styles/dwmkerr-editor.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwmkerr/editor/main/references/output-style.md
```

Then run `/config`, select **Output style** and pick `dwmkerr editor`. The
style is read at session start, so it applies after `/clear` or in the next
session.

The file sets `keep-coding-instructions: true`, which keeps Claude Code's
built-in software engineering instructions in place while the style changes the
tone. A custom style drops those instructions by default.

The style says nothing about length, since some answers need to be long. When
one comes back too dense, run `/editor wtf`.

### Troubleshooting the output style

- **The picker saves per project.** Choosing a style in `/config` writes
  `outputStyle` to `.claude/settings.local.json` in the current directory. Put
  it in `~/.claude/settings.json` to get it everywhere.
- **It applies at session start.** Run `/clear` or start a new session after
  changing it.
- **Hooks can override the style.** Anything that injects instructions on
  `UserPromptSubmit`, such as the caveman plugin, arrives after the system
  prompt on every turn and can take precedence over it. Caveman asks for the
  clipped fragments that `references/writing-style.md` forbids, so run one or
  the other.

## Developer guide

Install the current checkout to apply local edits immediately:

```sh
# Install to every agent found on the machine.
npx skills add . --global --all

# Or pick the agents yourself, interactively or by name.
npx skills add . --global
npx skills add . --global --agent claude-code codex
```

`npx skills` installs to whichever agents it detects - Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode and Warp among them. `--all` installs every skill
for every detected agent without prompting. Drop `--global` to install into the current project
instead of the user directory.

Re-run the same command to update after a change. To uninstall, run
`npx skills remove --global editor`.

Run the checks and rebuild the hero image with:

```sh
make test    # structural checks
make hero    # rebuild site/assets/hero.gif (needs vhs)
```
